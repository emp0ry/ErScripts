# ErScripts üéÆ  
### Elevate Your *Counter-Strike 2* Experience  

**ErScripts** is a lightweight, multi-feature tool designed to enhance your *Counter-Strike 2 (CS2)* gameplay. Designed to run outside the game, it steers clear of memory injection or game tampering (no reading or writing memory), making it **completely safe** for Valve servers like Premier and Matchmaking.

## ‚ú® What is ErScripts?

**ErScripts** supercharges your CS2 experience with a sleek overlay, real-time game data, and smart automation. It taps into what the game provides, retrieving data through:

- **External Overlay**: Tracks CS2‚Äôs window position and size.
- **Config & Binds**: Sends commands via `exec` binds (e.g., `bind "KEY" "exec erscripts"`).
- **Game State Integration (GSI)**: Pulls live data like weapons and bomb status.
- **Console Logs**: Reads `console.log` for game insights.

No hacks, no bans‚Äîjust pure, clean enhancement.

### Auto Accept
- **Waiting Time**: Set a timer in seconds for the time it takes to search for the "Accept" button.

### Bomb Timer
- **Scale**: Timer size.
- **Gradient**: Toggle gradient bomb icon.

  - You can write without specifying `.wav` (e.g., if it‚Äôs `sound.wav`, just write `sound`).

## üß† How It Works

ErScripts is clever but safe:

- **Auto Accept**: Reads `console.log` for match detection, then clicks Accept button.
- **Pixel Trigger**: Monitors center-screen pixels for color shifts, triggering shots.
- **Sniper Crosshair**: Pulls active weapon data from GSI to detect sniper rifles, then mirrors your crosshair by sending commands through a config and reading data from `console.log`.
- **Bomb Timer**: Tracks bomb state via GSI, changes color for defuse urgency.
- **RGB Crosshair**: Cycles colors with console commands.
- **Knife Switch**: Toggles hands with `switchhands` via configs.
- **Auto Pistol**: Spams `attack` commands for rapid fire.

Everything runs externally‚Äîno game memory touched, no risks taken.
